    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Guys, this air fryer salmon has changed my salmon game. It’s loaded with flavor, and the air fryer gives it a crusty, crisped exterior while keeping a consistently juicy, buttery interior texture. Each piece just gently slips apart when you press a fork on it, and it is utterly delightful. This one goes in my forever files!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1lb salmon</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon chilli powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon coarse kosher salt</li>
        <li>2-3 teaspoons avocado or olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Prep the salmon: Remove the skin from your salmon, if it has skin. Pat with paper towels so the surface is mostly dry. Cut your salmon into cubes, 1 to 2 inches each</li>
        <li>Prep the spices: Mix the spices together in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Toss salmon with spices: Toss your salmon cubes in the spices and oil – I usually use my hands to mix it all together.</li>
        <li>Air fry the salmon: Place your salmon pieces in the air fryer (I just dump them right in) and spread them out a bit so they’re not laying all over each other. Air fry at 400 degrees for 8 minutes!</li>
        <li>You’re Done! Yum! At this point it should be textured and golden on the outside, and juicy and delicious on the inside. When you press each piece with a fork, they should easily flake / slip apart with a buttery, juicy texture inside. (You can do 6-7 minutes if you prefer more of a medium doneness.)</li>
    </ol>
